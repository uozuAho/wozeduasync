Written following Jon Skeet's blog: https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2011/05/13/eduasync-part-3-the-shape-of-the-async-method-awaitable-boundary/

Written using dotnet core 2.1, so things have changed a bit since Jon wrote the above.

To see the generated code with dotPeek, open the build dll with dotPeek,
right-click on wozeduasync->Program and select Decompiled Sources.
